Cutting rope
Problem 398


Inside a rope of length n, n-1 points are placed with distance 1 from each other and from the endpoints. Among these points, we choose m-1 points at random and cut the rope at these points to create m segments.


Let E(n, m) be the expected length of the second-shortest segment.

Find E(107, 100).
