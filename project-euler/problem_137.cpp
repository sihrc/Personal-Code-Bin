Fibonacci golden nuggets
Problem 137

Consider the infinite polynomial series AF(x) = xF1 + x2F2 + x3F3 + ..., where Fk is the kth term in the Fibonacci sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... ; that is, Fk = Fk1 + Fk2, F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
For this problem we shall be interested in values of x for which AF(x) is a positive integer.
The corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.
We shall call AF(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 10th golden nugget is 74049690.
Find the 15th golden nugget.
