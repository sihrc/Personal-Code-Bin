Coresilience
Problem 245

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4‚ÅÑ11.
Find the sum of all composite integers 1  n  21011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
